🛑 LOGIC DEBUG & FIX: Poker Portal Real-Time Chat (Player ↔ Staff)
🚩 Symptoms
Player portal sends, “hello Prasidh” — does NOT arrive in staff portal.

Staff portal sends, “hello there Keerthi” — does NOT show in player portal.

Messages sometimes show test/fake content or are assigned to wrong user.

Possible legacy/demo chat entries still appear.

Chat system claims all connections are “correct” but user flow and ID mapping are clearly glitched.

✅ ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION CHECKLIST
1. Verify Real Player & Staff ID Mapping
 Double-check: When a chat message is sent,

 It includes the real sender’s playerId, greStaffId, AND playerName/greName.

 These values match Supabase database's latest records.

 No hardcoded names/IDs (“Vignesh”, “Keerthi”, “Test User”, etc.) remain anywhere except in test migration files.

2. Backend Table Source Check
 Confirm chat messages, chat requests, and chat sessions are being inserted, queried, and broadcast ONLY from the production tables:

gre_chat_messages

gre_chat_sessions (or chat_requests if that is the join table)

 No demo tables or alternate/legacy DBs are referenced, no “test_” table names anywhere in live code.

3. Supabase/Env Consistency
 Check all .env files for both portals. All endpoints must use the same exact Supabase project and keys.

SUPABASE_URL

SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

 NO “dev”, “test”, “backup”, “alta” configs used for any client.

4. Correct Chat Routing Logic
 When a staff (GRE) sends a message, the backend must:

 Tag it with senderType: 'gre', and correct greStaffId.

 Route/broadcast it ONLY to the matching player's open session.

 When a player sends a message, backend must:

 Tag with senderType: 'player', real playerId.

 Route to GRE portal session for that player.

5. Message Fetch & Broadcast
 When loading chat history for a conversation,

 The UI queries only messages where playerId matches the session, not “all” or demo ones.

 On message send, websocket must broadcast to all active clients representing that session/player.

6. Frontend State Mapping
 UI receives and renders new messages based on playerId or sessionId props.

 No leftover mapping logic that would mismatch staff/players (e.g., index-based lookups instead of ID-based).

7. Database Cleanup (One Time)
 Clear out any demo/test chat data via SQL (optional but recommended for sanity).

💡 Expert Debug + Fix Steps
Add backend debug logs to every chat handler:

Print playerId, greStaffId, senderType, playerName, messageText for every send.

Add frontend logs just before outgoing sends and upon each message receipt.

Try a chat from both sides.

After each send, check the logs for:

Which player ID/name got attached

Which backend API endpoint received/stored it

What WebSocket recipients (if any) were targeted

If IDs/names mismatch at any step, check:

Where/how are you populating playerId, greStaffId, and names for each send?

Is there a mistaken use of test/demo defaults in one portal, or stale user context?

After fixing, test again.

Each chat session must match correct player and staff.

Chat history must show correct sequence, real names, and real text on both player and GRE views, instantly.

🚩 Copy-Paste Debug Prompts
“Add a backend debug log to every chat send and receive handler showing playerId, greStaffId, messageText, senderType, sessionId/playerName for each message.”

“Add a frontend console.log for every outgoing and incoming message showing the full content and all relevant IDs/names.”

“If playerName doesn’t match the one currently logged in, or any message is assigned to the wrong user, print where the values are sourced and fix to always use the real, live user.”

“No references should remain to any legacy or initial test/demo data.”

Once you finish, paste the logs for one successful two-way chat.
Only mark as fixed if:

The right message sent from the right portal appears instantly on the other—without fake data, mismatched names, or session confusion.
