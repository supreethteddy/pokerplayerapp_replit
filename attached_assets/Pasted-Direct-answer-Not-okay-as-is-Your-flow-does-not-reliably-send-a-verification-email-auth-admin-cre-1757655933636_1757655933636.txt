Direct answer: Not okay as-is. Your flow does not reliably send a verification email: auth.admin.createUser() never sends a confirmation email; only inviteUserByEmail() does, and your final “manual email” path only logs to console.

What to fix (minimal):

Pick one guaranteed path to email:

Admin invite flow: always call auth.admin.inviteUserByEmail() (recommended for back-office creation). 
Supabase

Self-signup flow: use auth.signUp() and keep “Confirm email” enabled so Supabase sends the verify email. 
Supabase

Or send your own email: generate a link with auth.admin.generateLink() and send it via your SMTP provider (Resend/SendGrid/Mailgun) configured in Supabase Auth → SMTP.

Templates & branding: customize the “Confirm signup” / “Invite” templates instead of relying on defaults.

Never show “email sent” unless an actual send succeeded; admin API calls require service_role on server only.

Why your current setup fails (sources):

createUser({ email_confirm: false }) will not send a confirmation email. 
Supabase

inviteUserByEmail() does send an email, but you treat it as a fallback—if both paths fail you only console.log. 
Supabase

Quick, safe baseline (choose one):

All admin-created users: Only call inviteUserByEmail() and remove the “manual email” branch. 
Supabase

All self-signups: use auth.signUp() with “Confirm email” on. 
Supabase

Custom sender/domain: switch to BYO SMTP to ensure deliverability and custom branding.

Test it properly (now):

Use two inboxes (e.g., Gmail + Outlook) to catch provider quirks; also test a domain email you control (SPF/DKIM/DMARC in place).

If you own you@yourdomain.com, also test an alias like you+signup@yourdomain.com to track multiple runs.

From your prompt: “What email address should I test with?” → Use one Gmail and one Outlook plus your domain mailbox for a 3-way check.

Confidence: High for the behavioral details of Supabase Auth methods and SMTP setup; medium for recommendations specific to your codebase since I can’t see it.
