Perfect question! Let me show you exactly where the notification system is implemented and how it works for all three scenarios:

🔔 Notification Implementation Locations
1. Table Assignment Notifications
File: server/routes.ts
Location: Lines 4086-4107
Endpoint: PUT /api/seat-requests/:id/assign

// 🔔 PUSHER NOTIFICATION: Table Assignment
try {
  console.log(`🔔 Sending table assignment notification to player ${updatedSeatRequest.player_id}`);
  
  await PusherChatService.notifyTableAssignment(
    updatedSeatRequest.player_id,
    {
      tableId: updatedSeatRequest.table_id,
      tableName: table.name,
      seatNumber: updatedSeatRequest.seat_number || 0,
      gameType: "Texas Hold'em",
      minBuyIn: 1000,
      maxBuyIn: 10000,
      tableStatus: tableStatus?.status || 'waiting'
    }
  );
  
  console.log(`✅ Table assignment notification sent to player ${updatedSeatRequest.player_id}`);
} catch (notificationError) {
  console.error(`❌ Failed to send table assignment notification:`, notificationError);
}
2. Table Activation Notifications
File: server/routes.ts
Location: Lines 1999-2045
Endpoint: PATCH /api/tables/:id

// 🔔 PUSHER NOTIFICATION: Table Activation
if (currentTable && currentTable.status !== "active" && status === "active") {
  try {
    console.log(`🔔 Sending table activation notifications for table ${id}`);
    
    // Get all seated players for this table
    const { data: seatedPlayers, error: playersError } = await supabase
      .from("seat_requests")
      .select("player_id, seat_number")
      .eq("table_id", id.toString())
      .eq("status", "seated");
    // Send notification to each seated player
    for (const seatRequest of seatedPlayers) {
      await PusherChatService.notifyTableActivation(
        seatRequest.player_id,
        {
          tableId: id,
          tableName: table.name,
          seatNumber: seatRequest.seat_number || 0,
          gameType: "Texas Hold'em",
          minBuyIn: 1000,
          maxBuyIn: 10000,
          tableStatus: status
        }
      );
    }
  } catch (notificationError) {
    console.error(`❌ Failed to send table activation notifications:`, notificationError);
  }
}
🎯 Three Notification Scenarios
Scenario 1: Player Assigned to Active Table
Trigger: Staff assigns player to table that's already active
Notification: Only table-assignment event sent immediately
Channel: player-{playerId}
Scenario 2: Player Assigned to Waiting Table
Trigger: Staff assigns player to table that's in waiting status
Notifications:
table-assignment event sent immediately
table-activation event sent later when table becomes active
Scenario 3: Table Activation with Seated Players
Trigger: Staff activates a table that has seated players
Notification: table-activation event sent to all seated players
Channel: player-{playerId} for each seated player
📡 Pusher Service Implementation
File: server/services/pusher.ts
Methods:

notifyTableAssignment(playerId, tableData)
notifyTableActivation(playerId, tableData)
🔍 How to Monitor Notifications
You can grab notification details from:

Server Logs: Look for these console messages:

🔔 Sending table assignment notification to player X
🔔 Sending table activation notifications for table X
✅ Table assignment notification sent to player X
✅ Table activation notification sent to player X
Pusher Dashboard: Monitor channels player-{playerId} for events:

table-assignment
table-activation
Frontend Integration: Players can subscribe to player-{playerId} channel to receive these notifications in real-time.

The notification data includes table name, seat number, game type, buy-in limits, and table status - everything a player needs to know about their table assignment and activation status!
