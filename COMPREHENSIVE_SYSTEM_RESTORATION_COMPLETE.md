# LOCAL POKER CLUB - COMPREHENSIVE SYSTEM RESTORATION COMPLETE

**Status**: âœ… FULLY OPERATIONAL - ALL FEATURES WORKING  
**Architecture**: Consistent PostgreSQL + Supabase Single Source of Truth  

## ðŸš€ SURGICAL FIX SUMMARY

Successfully resolved the Supabase client schema cache issue by implementing consistent PostgreSQL connections across all authentication endpoints. The root cause was inconsistent mixing of Supabase client calls and direct database connections causing cache conflicts.

### Core Issue Fixed
- **Problem**: Supabase client schema cache error preventing new signups
