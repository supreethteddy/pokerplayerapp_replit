# üéØ UNIFIED CROSS-PORTAL INTEGRATION GUIDE
## Standardized Communication Protocol for All Poker Room Portals

### üöÄ **CRITICAL UPDATE: WAITLIST SYSTEM CONSOLIDATED**

**The Player Portal has been updated to use the unified `waitlist` table system. All portals must now use this standardized approach.**

---

## üìã **UNIFIED WAITLIST SYSTEM**

### **Database Structure**
All portals now use the **`waitlist` table** exclusively:

```sql
-- PRIMARY WAITLIST TABLE (Use this for all portals)
waitlist {
  id: uuid (primary key)
  player_id: integer (foreign key to players table)
  table_id: uuid (foreign key to poker_tables table)
  game_type: text (e.g., "Texas Hold'em", "Omaha")
  min_buy_in: numeric (minimum buy-in amount in rupees)
  max_buy_in: numeric (maximum buy-in amount in rupees)
  position: integer (position in waitlist)
  status: text ("waiting", "seated", "cancelled")
  requested_at: timestamp (when player joined waitlist)
  seated_at: timestamp (when player was seated - nullable)
  notes: text (staff notes or comments)
  created_at: timestamp
  updated_at: timestamp
}

-- DEPRECATED: seat_requests table (DO NOT USE)
-- This table has been deprecated in favor of the unified waitlist table
```

### **API Endpoints - Universal for All Portals**

## üîß **IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE FOR ALL PORTALS**

### **For Staff Portal Integration:**

1. **Update Your API Calls:**
   - Replace any `seat_requests` table references with `waitlist` table
   - Use the new API endpoints above
   - All responses now include poker room context (game_type, min_buy_in, max_buy_in)

2. **Database Queries:**
   ```sql
   -- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Use waitlist table
   SELECT * FROM waitlist WHERE table_id = 'your-table-id';
   
   -- ‚ùå WRONG: Don't use seat_requests table
   SELECT * FROM seat_requests WHERE table_id = 'your-table-id';
   ```

### **For Super Admin Portal Integration:**

1. **Waitlist Management:**
   - Use `/api/waitlist/table/{tableId}` for comprehensive table waitlist view
   - All waitlist entries include player details and poker room context
   - Position management automatically calculated

2. **Cross-Portal Synchronization:**
   - All changes to waitlist instantly sync across Player Portal, Staff Portal, and Super Admin Portal
   - Real-time updates via Supabase subscriptions

### **For Manager Portal Integration:**

1. **Table Assignment:**
   - When creating/updating tables, the waitlist system automatically includes poker room details
   - `game_type`, `min_buy_in`, `max_buy_in` are automatically populated from poker_tables

2. **Waitlist Monitoring:**
   - Use standard waitlist endpoints for real-time monitoring
   - All portals see identical waitlist data structure

### **For Admin Portal Integration:**

1. **Player Management:**
   - Full waitlist history available via player ID
   - Cross-reference with KYC and transaction systems
   - Universal ID system ensures consistent player identification
