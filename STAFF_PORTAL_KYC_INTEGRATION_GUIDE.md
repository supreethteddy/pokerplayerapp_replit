# Staff Portal KYC Integration Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the complete KYC (Know Your Customer) integration between the Player Portal and Staff Portal, including Clerk authentication, Supabase database integration, and document management workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

### Authentication System
- **Primary**: Supabase Auth for unified player authentication
- **Secondary**: Clerk integration with hybrid support
- **Unified ID**: All players have both `supabase_user_id` and `clerk_user_id` for cross-platform compatibility

### Database Schema (Supabase)

#### Core Tables

##### `players` Table
```sql
- id (UUID) - Primary key
- clerk_user_id (TEXT) - Clerk user identifier
- supabase_user_id (UUID) - Supabase auth.users foreign key
- email (TEXT) - Player email
- first_name (TEXT) - Player first name
- last_name (TEXT) - Player last name
- phone (TEXT) - Player phone number
- pan_card (TEXT) - PAN card number
- kyc_status (TEXT) - 'pending', 'submitted', 'approved', 'rejected'
- created_at (TIMESTAMP)
- updated_at (TIMESTAMP)
```

##### `kyc_documents` Table
```sql
- id (UUID) - Primary key
- player_id (UUID) - Foreign key to players.id
- document_type (TEXT) - 'government_id', 'utility_bill', 'pan_card'
- file_name (TEXT) - Original filename
- file_url (TEXT) - Document storage URL
- file_size (INTEGER) - File size in bytes
- mime_type (TEXT) - File MIME type
- status (TEXT) - 'pending', 'approved', 'rejected'
- uploaded_at (TIMESTAMP)
- reviewed_at (TIMESTAMP)
- reviewed_by (UUID) - Staff member who reviewed
```

### Database Queries for Staff Portal

```

#### Get Documents for Review
```sql
SELECT p.*, d.* 
FROM players p
LEFT JOIN kyc_documents d ON p.id = d.player_id
WHERE p.kyc_status = 'submitted'
ORDER BY d.uploaded_at DESC;
```

#### Approve Player KYC
```sql
UPDATE players 
SET kyc_status = 'approved', updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id = $1;

UPDATE kyc_documents 
SET status = 'approved', reviewed_at = NOW(), reviewed_by = $2

```

## üö® Error Handling
