# Poker Room Player Portal

## Overview

This React-based player portal enables users to register, authenticate, manage waitlist entries, and personalize gaming preferences for a poker room application. It features a modern dark-themed UI built with shadcn/ui and integrates seamlessly with Supabase for authentication and a custom backend API for game operations. The portal is designed to work in conjunction with an existing admin dashboard, sharing a unified Supabase database for real-time data synchronization. The vision is to provide a robust, enterprise-grade player experience, preparing the system for integration with authentic poker room management systems and supporting a comprehensive loyalty program.
