# Poker Room Player Portal

## Overview

This is a React-based player portal for a poker room application that allows players to register, authenticate, join table waitlists, and manage their gaming preferences. The application features a modern dark theme UI built with shadcn/ui components and integrates with both Supabase for authentication and a custom backend API for game-related operations.

This player portal is designed to work alongside an existing admin dashboard, sharing the same Supabase database and authentication system for seamless integration and real-time data synchronization.

## Data Flow

1. **User Registration**: Supabase Auth → Custom API creates player profile → Default preferences created
2. **Authentication**: Supabase session → Fetch player data from custom API
3. **Table Operations**: Real-time table data fetching → Join wait list → Position updates
4. **Preferences**: Local UI changes → API updates → Query cache invalidation

## External Dependencies

### Core Services

- **Backend**: ESBuild compiles TypeScript server to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Drizzle migrations applied via `drizzle-kit push`

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Local development with hot reload via Vite
- **Production**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

### Key Scripts
- `npm run dev`: Start development server with hot reload
- `npm run build`: Build both frontend and backend for production
- `npm run start`: Start production server
- `npm run db:push`: Apply database schema changes

The application follows a monorepo structure with shared TypeScript types and schemas, enabling type safety between frontend and backend while maintaining clear separation of concerns.
