# Poker Room Player Portal

## Overview

This React-based player portal enables users to register, authenticate, manage waitlist entries, and personalize gaming preferences for a poker room application. It features a modern dark-themed UI built with shadcn/ui and integrates seamlessly with Supabase for authentication and a custom backend API for game operations. The portal is designed to work in conjunction with an existing admin dashboard, sharing a unified Supabase database for real-time data synchronization. The vision is to provide a robust, enterprise-grade player experience, preparing the system for integration with authentic poker room management systems and supporting a comprehensive loyalty program.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite 5.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a dark theme, utilizing shadcn/ui components and Radix UI primitives.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and custom hooks for local state.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Incorporates a clean, minimalist design for signup, a professional dark theme with Tilt branding for login, and a responsive layout optimized for mobile devices. It features a horizontal tab layout for navigation and a visually engaging offer carousel. VIP Club sections use a golden theme.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL serves as the unified database for both player and staff portals, acting as the single source of truth.
- **Storage**: Direct Supabase integration for all data operations, including KYC documents and chat messages.
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for managing players, tables, preferences, KYC, waitlists, VIP points, and chat.
- **Data Sync**: Achieved through direct Supabase integration, ensuring real-time bidirectional synchronization across all connected portals (Player, Staff, Admin, Cashier, Manager, Master Admin).

### Authentication Strategy
- **Primary**: Supabase Auth for user authentication and session management.
- **Integration**: Shares the same Supabase instance with admin dashboards for unified user management and consistent player identification (Supabase `auth.users.id` and application `players.id`).
- **Enterprise Security**: **FULLY OPERATIONAL** Clerk integration provides invisible enterprise-grade security layer with complete audit logging, webhook infrastructure, and cross-portal synchronization. Database tables: `clerk_webhook_events`, `clerk_sync_log` with comprehensive player tracking.
