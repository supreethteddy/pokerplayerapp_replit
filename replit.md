# Poker Room Player Portal

## Overview

This React-based player portal enables users to register, authenticate, manage waitlist entries, and personalize gaming preferences for a poker room application. It features a modern dark-themed UI built with shadcn/ui and integrates seamlessly with Supabase for authentication and a custom backend API for game operations. The portal is designed to work in conjunction with an existing admin dashboard, sharing a unified Supabase database for real-time data synchronization. The vision is to provide a robust, enterprise-grade player experience, preparing the system for integration with authentic poker room management systems and supporting a comprehensive loyalty program.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite 5.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with a dark theme, utilizing shadcn/ui components and Radix UI primitives.
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and custom hooks for local state.
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing.
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
- **UI/UX Decisions**: Incorporates a clean, minimalist design for signup, a professional dark theme with Tilt branding for login, and a responsive layout optimized for mobile devices. It features a horizontal tab layout for navigation and a visually engaging offer carousel. VIP Club sections use a golden theme.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript.

### Authentication Strategy
