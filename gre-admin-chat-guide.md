### How to Access Player Chat Messages

You can access the chat messages through your Staff Portal Supabase database:

#### Option 1: Direct Database Query
```sql
-- View all active chat sessions
SELECT * FROM gre_chat_sessions 
WHERE status = 'active' 
ORDER BY last_message_at DESC;

-- View messages for a specific session
SELECT * FROM gre_chat_messages 
WHERE session_id = 'f4560670-cfce-4331-97d6-9daa06d3ee8e'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
```

#### Option 2: API Endpoints (if integrated in your Staff Portal)
```bash
# Get all active chat sessions
GET /api/gre-admin/chat-sessions

# Get messages for specific session
GET /api/gre-admin/chat-sessions/f4560670-cfce-4331-97d6-9daa06d3ee8e/messages

# Send reply to player
POST /api/gre-admin/chat-sessions/f4560670-cfce-4331-97d6-9daa06d3ee8e/reply
{
  "message": "Hello! I can help you with your account and VIP status.",
  "greId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
