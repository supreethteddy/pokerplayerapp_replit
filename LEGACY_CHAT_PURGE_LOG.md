# LEGACY CHAT SYSTEM PURGE

**Date:** January 28, 2025  
**Time:** Current timestamp  

## Files Removed:
- `server/chat-system-broken.ts` - Broken chat system with malformed try-catch blocks
- `server/production-chat-system.ts` - Legacy production chat implementation  
- `server/unified-chat-system-complete.ts` - Outdated unified chat system
- `server/chat-system.ts` - Old chat system implementation

## Files Preserved:
- `client/src/components/UnifiedGreChatDialog.tsx` - Working chat dialog component
- `server/routes.ts` - Main routes file with working unified chat endpoints
- All Supabase/Pusher/OneSignal integration code

## Result:
- All legacy chat imports and dependencies removed
- TypeScript compilation cleaned up
- Only working chat system components remain
- Zero errors from removed files

**Note:** This cleanup preserves the functional chat system while removing all broken/legacy implementations that were causing TypeScript errors and compilation issues.
