**Date**: August 8, 2025  
**Issue**: Player 179 (Vignesh) chat messages not appearing in Staff Portal GRE system

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: The Staff Portal GRE endpoint `/api/gre-chat/requests` was completely missing from the server routes.

### Key Findings:

2. **All Messages Linked**: Fixed orphaned messages - all 4 messages now properly linked to chat request
3. **Database Data Correct**: All required fields (`player_name`, `player_email`, `source`, `status`) properly populated
4. **Staff Portal API Missing**: `/api/gre-chat/requests` endpoint returned HTML instead of JSON (404 error)
